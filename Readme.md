### Step 4 (automatic): When your guest RSVPs via the email invite, their RSVP status is displayed on the Event Details page for your event. If they RSVP 'Yes', a WealthEngine report is automatically generated for them via the WealthEngine API and stored in our database.

### Step 5: View the Wealth Reports for each guest who RSVPed 'Yes' and craft your pitch for your upcoming JavaHuddle based upon their Wealth Data!
